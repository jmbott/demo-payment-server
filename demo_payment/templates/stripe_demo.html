    <h3>Stripe</h3>
    <p>
      Stripe is split up into two processes on the web server, client and then
      server side. Client side JavaScript and the server side is dependent on
      what software stack is implemented. For this site the server side is
      written in Python.
    </p>
    <p>
      First displayed is an example and then further description. So here are
      some Stripe test card numbers that can be used in test mode but not live
      mode. Live mode is activated in the Stripe account console.

      You can use the button below to activate a Stripe modal or dialog popup
      box. Any email can be used as long as it follows the email syntax. Any
      zip code and check code can be used. The month and year are semantically
      restricted; you can't use an unreasonable year or a month higher than 12.

    <p>
      <b>For this to work your functioning Stripe secret key must be in the
      database.</b>
    </p>
    <form id="stripeToken" method="POST">
      <script
        src="https://checkout.stripe.com/checkout.js" class="stripe-button"

      The modal is configurable. Currently the publishable API key is stored in
      front end JavaScript and view-able in source. This could be further hidden
      in the backend database but is not usable without its matching secret
      API key. Below is a description from the docs,
    </p>
    <h5>Two types of API keys:
      <a href="https://stripe.com/docs/keys">publishable and secret.</a></h5>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Publishable</b> API keys are meant solely to identify your account with
        Stripe, they aren’t secret. In other words, they can safely be published
        in places like your Stripe.js JavaScript code, or in an Android or iPhone
        app. Publishable keys only have the power to create tokens.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Secret</b> API keys should be kept confidential and only stored on your own
        servers. Your account’s secret API key can perform any API request to
        Stripe without restriction.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h5>A few simple verification steps that can be performed (from the docs):
      <a href="https://stripe.com/docs/disputes/prevention#make-use-of-verification-checks">
        CVC and AVS.</a>
    </h5>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Card verification code check (CVC)</b> (also referred to as CVV)
        is the three- or four-digit number printed directly on the credit card,
        usually either on the signature strip or the front of the card.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Address verification (AVS)</b> is comprised of two checks: one
        based on the ZIP code and another based on the billing street address.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The frontend side creates a token from the provided information that is
      passed to the backend which creates a charge. It is possible to display
      a different amount to be charged than is actually charged. This is a
      reality of the structure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Output messages are displayed at the top of this page, good or bad.
      Stripe security is added to existing security structures of credit card
      companies to prevent fraudulent activity.
